This project is a learning project based on the YouTube tutorial by Web Dev Simplified. The tutorial can be found at [https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw](https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw).

## Self Reflection

What I learnt from this project was how to do plain javascript as I was relying on jquery alot and found that relying on a javascript library means you need to keep all your projects up to date.
