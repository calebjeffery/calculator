# Learning Project: Calculator

This project is a learning project based on the YouTube tutorial by Web Dev Simplified. The tutorial can be found at [https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw](https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw).

## Self-Reflection: Lessons Learned

During the course of this project, I gained valuable insights and expanded my knowledge in the realm of JavaScript development. One of the key takeaways from this experience was the realization of the importance of writing pure JavaScript code, as opposed to relying heavily on frameworks like jQuery.

By delving into plain JavaScript, I discovered that utilizing a JavaScript library, such as jQuery, often necessitates the need to diligently maintain and update projects to stay current with the library's versions and dependencies. This realization prompted me to explore and embrace the fundamental principles and capabilities of JavaScript itself.

This learning experience has empowered me to craft more efficient and sustainable code, reducing reliance on external libraries. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of JavaScript, I can create streamlined and robust solutions while maintaining greater control over the development process.

Moving forward, I intend to further sharpen my JavaScript skills and explore additional opportunities to enhance my understanding of other frameworks and technologies. This project served as a valuable stepping stone in my journey towards becoming a more proficient and knowledgeable JavaScript developer.
